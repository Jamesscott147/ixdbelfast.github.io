IXD102 - Introduction to Communication Design
====================

---

In this module we introduce students to the history of communication design. Starting with imagined communication devices of the future (Minority Report, Prometheus…) we rewind, in a single lecture, to the era of cave painting (Lascaux, Chauvet…), demonstrating the connections that bind human communication together.

For a more in-depth explanation of the module’s intent, including recommended reading, read the [abbreviated module descriptor](http://ixdbelfast.org/curriculum/0001/01/02/introduction-to-communication-design.html). (This module is run concurrently for students on both the BDes (Hons) Interaction Design and BSc (Hons) Interactive Multimedia Design courses.)

Week 01 - Introduction and Reverse History
------------------------------------------

Introduction to the module and a reverse view of what will be covered over the next eleven weeks.

### Friday Lecture

Today’s lecture covered a broad look at the module and what we are looking from you. 

The value of a solid knowledge and understanding of the history of design cannot be understated. As Confucius wisely said **“Study the past if you would define the future.”** Otherwise if you know what came before you will be equipped to design for whatever is to come. No one can work effectively in a creative vacuum.

If [Dieter Rams](https://www.vitsoe.com/gb/about/dieter-rams) hadn’t come across the [Ulm School of Design](http://www.hfg-archiv.ulm.de/english) he may never have developed his iconic design for the [Braun Radio](http://www.eyemagazine.com/blog/post/designing-for-dieter-rams) and if [Jonathan Ive](https://www.apple.com/uk/pr/bios/jonathan-ive.html) wasn’t aware of Rams he wouldn’t have designed the first iMac, iPod and the current range of Apple products we all know and love (or hate).


We looked at [Guillermo del Toro](http://www.fastcocreate.com/3020262/master-class/guillermo-del-toro-shares-14-horror-insights-from-his-spectacular-sketch-book) and saw how a knowledge and appreciation of past artists has helped him develop the fascinating creatures in the movies such as [Pan’s Labrynth](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0457430) and [Pacific Rim](http://www.pacificrimmovie.com).

*IxD should also keep a weekly journal of their thoughts and progress on this and the other modules. It will help you rationalise what is covered and will provide a vehicle in which you can refer back to when you need to research material for future projects.


### Friday IxD Seminar

To kick things off we introduced two essential tools any self respecting interaction designer should be familiar with. 

This week we need you to download yourself a copy of [Brackets](http://brackets.io/) or [Atom](https://atom.io). Equally iyou can stick to your own preferred text editor.  Using the text in the attachment below, render what you see in [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics). You should mark the headings, paragraphs, lists, etc as you see fit. 

Download the attached [Markdown zip file](resources/week01_markdown.zip) and, using the PDF as a guide, set the girona.txt file in Markdown. You won’t be able to match the PDF exactly (this will come later with the aid of the magic of CSS) but set it as you see fit using Markdown in your text editor.

#### Research Extras…

This weeks must watch movie is [2001 A Space Odyssey](http://www.bbc.com/culture/story/20180404-why-2001-a-space-odyssey-remains-a-mystery). Yes, watching a movie can be research.

Week 02 – Cave Paintings to Illuminated Manuscripts
---------------------------------------------------

Starting with cave paintings we move forward to the first written language and end with illuminated manuscripts.

We covered a lot today with any one aspect worthy of a lecture in itself. But we have a lot more to cover in the coming weeks and rather than go into too much detail on the early history, today provided a taste for a number of different areas.

From man’s earliest markings at [Cantabria](http://cuevas.culturadecantabria.com/english/default.htm) the human race has been leaving its mark on the world in many different visual forms. They have been the source of inspiration for designers and artists such as [Picasso](http://www.picasso.fr/us/picasso_page_index.php), writers and movie directors such as [Ridley Scott](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000631/).

[Early writing](http://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/themes/writing/historic_writing.aspx) forms cover millennia of mans history, with many different forms developing throughout the world. Thankfully, as designers, we usually only need to work with one language in our day-to-day routine, but on occasions we will need our work translated onto others. 

The [Golden Ratio](http://www.goldennumber.net) is abundant in nature and has been used by architects, artists and designers in the creation of their work for centuries. While not the only way to approach the design of your own work it is certainly a solid, tried-and-tested place to start.

[Tim Brown](https://dribbble.com/timbrown) has created a very useful online [Modular Scale](http://www.modularscale.com) which will help you – once you get to grips with CSS – to develop a well controlled balance to the typography on your Design Journal. Jeremy Church’s [Type Scale](http://type-scale.com) adds a very easy visual dimension to it. What’s more you can grab the CSS from here and add it to your own site.

Make sure to read Christopher Murphy’s [Contrast Through Scale](http://typecast.com/blog/contrast-through-scale) on Typecast's blog and add your thoughts in your Design Journal. 

Handwritten books, for many, many years, were the only way society could share and gather knowledge. The privilege of the powerful, religious bodies and the very rich, books were extremely expensive to reproduce restricting the spread of knowledge to those who could afford it.

Books were painstakingly created by [scribes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scribe), taking many months to complete one book, you can appreciate they were not cheap!

But by the mid 15th Century that was about to dramatically change and the days of the [Illuminated Scripts](https://www.bl.uk/catalogues/illuminatedmanuscripts/TourIntroGen.asp) were numbered.

### Pocket Profiles

Today we started to look at some of the key figures in the Interaction Design industry. I would encourage all of you to take deeper look at the three we covered today and post your thoughts on your research blog.

The people covered were:
- [Wilson Miner](https://wilsonminer.com/)
- [Rachel Andrew](https://rachelandrew.co.uk/)  
- [Jeffrey Zeldman](http://www.zeldman.com/)

### Resources
- [Brainpickings: A 5-Step Technique for Producing Ideas](https://www.brainpickings.org/2012/05/04/a-technique-for-producing-ideas-young)

Week 03 – Guttenberg and Moveable Type
--------------------------------------

**The invention of the printing press revolutionises the dissemination of information and starts a typographic revolution in the process.**

This weeks lecture looked at the impact of the printing press and its influence on the spread of knowledge in the western world. We also picked out some of the pioneers of type design, looking at how improvements in the printing process helped shape the design of type. 

### Typography Today

A solid understanding of and appreciation for type is essential to your development as designers or developers. We will touch on typography frequently this semester and through all of the design modules so learn as much as you can about type. It will make you a stronger, better designer.

The following links to online resources and books will get you kicked off.

#### Web Typography

Check out Tim Brown’s [Nice Web Type](http://nicewebtype.com)

[Typekit][2] is a great way to get started with proper web fonts with lots of choices of good quality type. Unless you are familiar with CSS at this moment wait until that has been covered in your other module. You will be able to use two fonts free of charge on the trial account.

A showcase for Google fonts can be found on [hellohappy.org][4]

The home grown [Typecast](https://typecast.com) is well worth taking a look at and starting to use. 

A List Apart’s piece on [Typography & Web Fonts](http://alistapart.com/topic/typography-web-fonts) is worth reading. In fact you should keep a regular eye on [A List Apart](http://alistapart.com) for articles on all things web related.

[The League of Moveable Type’s blog](http://blog.theleagueofmoveabletype.com) is worth checking out

The people covered were:
- [Jakob Nielsen](https://www.nngroup.com/)
- [Sarah Parmenter](http://www.sazzy.co.uk/)
